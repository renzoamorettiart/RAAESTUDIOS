# RAAESTUDIOS
I am an independent Artist oriented to different disciplines: traditional, digital illustration and graphic design. I seek the exploration of new artistic forms, with a voracious appetite for addressing themes where everything is projected on a new and experimental scale, with the confidence that the final result will be fantastic.
